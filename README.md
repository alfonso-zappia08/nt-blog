# Learn React as a self-taught

Hi, I am Alfonso, I am 23 years old and an Italian student. And this is my first project with React.js

## Who am I?

I am a computer science student at the University of Salerno. I am currently just a few exams away from graduating, but I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, especially in the web area. I am also a big fan of football, hiking and cinema. 

## What am I creating?

NT-Blog is a blog that will be realised through MERN technologies (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), for a fullstack project. NT-Blog will be a website where users can read, write and comment on articles about national football teams. 

## What do I have in mind for the future?

My field of interest is cybersecurity, a path I will also want to pursue during my Master's degree. However, I also really enjoy web design and so my intention is to always create new projects, which relate to my greatest passions. 

## Short Reminder

NT-Blog wasn't created, to date, either to be sold or to be hosted. I don't know what I'll do once it's finished, but I would like to say that, prior to this project, I had never touched MERN technology, so I'm taking my cue from an online tutorial. I leave the link to Mohammad Rezaii's YouTube channel, from which I took much of the inspiration.
Thank you for your attention and I wish you a good continuation.
